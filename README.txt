Presidential Demographics

This is the source code for the visualization applet at
<http://eagereyes.org/applications/PresidentialDemographicsII.html>.

It is released under the BSD License.

The data was scraped from Wikipedia's list of US presidents:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States>
and from the individual pages about each president.

You can directly import this directory as a project into Eclipse. To run, right-click
on PresidentialDemographics.java and select Run As -> Java Applet. It works best in
a window of 580x505 (wider is always better, but it won't use more height without
changes to the code).

Enjoy!
